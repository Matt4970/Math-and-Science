## Significant Digits
Uncertainty: The inexactness of the measuring device and the need to estimate when taking a reading.

### Multiplication and Division
Pay attention to significant figures.

### Addition and Subtraction
Pay attention to the number of decimal places.
83.5 mL + 23.28 mL = 106.8 mL (not 106.78 mL)

### Logarithms
Answers have the same number of significant figures **after** the decimal place as there are in the number who's logarithm was taken.
pH = -log[H+] = -log 0.0**105** = 1.**979**

## Rounding
If the number before the 5 is odd round up. If the number preceding the 5 is even round down.

17.75 = 17.8
17.65 = 17.6

## Exact Numbers
An **exact number** has no uncertainty associated with it. Some exact numbers are part of a unit conversion: by definition, there are exactly 60 minutes in 1 hour, 1000 ug in 1 mg.

## Determining Which Digits are Significant
All of the digits are significant except zeroes used only to position the decimal point.

1. Make sure that the measurement has a decimal point.
2. Start at the left, and move right until you reach the first nonzero digit.
3. Count this digit and every digit to its right as significant.

### Zeroes at the End
- If there is a decimal point and the zeroes lie either before or after it they *are* significant.
- If there is *no* decimal point, we assume that the zeroes are *not* significant, unless exponential notation clarifies the quantity: 5300 is *assumed* to have two significant digits.
- A terminal decimal point indicates that zeroes are significant: 500 mL has one significant figure, but 500. mL has three.
