# Elements, Compounds and Mixtures
Matter can be classified into three types based on its composition. Elements, compounds and mixtures. A **substance** is matter whose composition is fixed.
1. Elements. An **element** is the simplest type of matter with unique chemical and physical properties. It consists of atoms with the same atomic number (number of protons) and, therefore, cannot be broken down into a simpler type of matter by any method. The macroscopic properties such as color, density or combustibility are different between elements because their submicroscopic properties are different. *Each element is unique because the properties of it's atoms are unique*. Most elements exist as diatomic or polyatomic structures which are known as elementary substances. These molecules are two or more atoms bound together. For example oxygen gas is two oxygen atoms.
2. Compounds. A **compound** consists of two or more of the same or different elements that are bonded chemically. Their atoms have joined in a chemical reaction and were not just mixed. *The elements are present in fixed parts*. This is because *each compound contains a set amount of atoms from each element*. The compounds properties are different then that of the elements that create the compound.
3. Mixtures. A **mixture** consists of two or more compounds that are physically mixed. Since a mixture is **not** a substance the mixture can vary in their parts by mass. So unlike compounds a mixture retains many of the properties of it's components. Also unlike compounds mixtures **can** be separated into their components by physical changes like boiling.
# Dalton's Atomic Theory
1. All matter consists of **atoms**, tiny indivisible particles of an element that cannot be created or destroyed.
2. Atoms of one element *cannot* be converted into atoms of another element. In chemical reactions, the atoms of the original substances recombine to form different substances.
3. Atoms of an element are identical in mass and other properties and are different from atoms of any other element. 
4. Compounds result from the chemical combination of a specific ratio of atoms of different elements.

# The Observations That Led to the Nuclear Atom Model
## Discovery of the Electron and It's Properties
### Cathode Rays
To discover its nature, some investigators tried passing electric current through nearly evacuated glass tubes fitted with metal electrodes. When the electric power source was turned, a "ray" could be seen striking the phosphor coated end of the tube and emitting a glowing spot of light. The rays were called **cathode rays** because they originated at the negative electrode (cathode) and moved to the positive electrode (anode).

### Mass and Charge of the Electron
1. Mass/charge ratio. J. J. Thomson measured the ratio of the mass of a cathode ray particle to its charge. By comparing this ratio with the mass/charge ratio for the lightest charged particle in solution, Thomson estimated that the cathode ray particle weighted less than 1/100 as much as hydrogen, the lightest atom.
2. Charge. Robert Millikan measured the charge of the electron. Accomplished by observing the movement of oil droplets in an apparatus that contained electrically charged plates and an X-ray source. X-rays knocked electrons from has molecules in the air within the apparatus, and the electrons stuck to an oil droplet falling through a hole in a positively charged plate. With the electric field off, Millikan measured the mass of the droplet from its rate of fall. Then, by adjusting the field's strength, he made the droplet hang suspended in the air and, thus, measured it's total charge.
3. Conclusion: Calculating the mass of an electron.

Mass of electron = mass/charge x charge 
$$ = (-5.686*10^{-12}\frac{kg}{C})(-1.602*10^{-19}C) $$
$$ = 9.109*10^{-31}kg = 9.109*10^{-28}g $$
