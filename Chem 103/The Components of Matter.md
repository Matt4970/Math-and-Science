# Elements, Compounds and Mixtures
Matter can be classified into three types based on its composition. Elements, compounds and mixtures. A **substance** is matter whose composition is fixed.
1. Elements. An **element** is the simplest type of matter with unique chemical and physical properties. It consists of atoms with the same atomic number (number of protons) and, therefore, cannot be broken down into a simpler type of matter by any method. The macroscopic properties such as color, density or combustibility are different between elements because their submicroscopic properties are different. *Each element is unique because the properties of it's atoms are unique*. Most elements exist as diatomic or polyatomic structures which are known as elementary substances. These molecules are two or more atoms bound together. For example oxygen gas is two oxygen atoms.
2. Compounds. A **compound** consists of two or more of the same or different elements that are bonded chemically. Their atoms have joined in a chemical reaction and were not just mixed. *The elements are present in fixed parts*. This is because *each compound contains a set amount of atoms from each element*. The compounds properties are different then that of the elements that create the compound.
3. Mixtures. A **mixture** consists of two or more compounds that are physically mixed. Since a mixture is **not** a substance the mixture can vary in their parts by mass. So unlike compounds a mixture retains many of the properties of it's components. Also unlike compounds mixtures **can** be separated into their components by physical changes like boiling.
# Dalton's Atomic Theory
1. All matter consists of **atoms**, tiny indivisible particles of an element that cannot be created or destroyed.
2. Atoms of one element *cannot* be converted into atoms of another element. In chemical reactions, the atoms of the original substances recombine to form different substances.
3. Atoms of an element are identical in mass and other properties and are different from atoms of any other element. 
4. Compounds result from the chemical combination of a specific ratio of atoms of different elements.

# The Observations That Led to the Nuclear Atom Model
## Discovery of the Electron and It's Properties
### Cathode Rays
To discover its nature, some investigators tried passing electric current through nearly evacuated glass tubes fitted with metal electrodes. When the electric power source was turned, a "ray" could be seen striking the phosphor coated end of the tube and emitting a glowing spot of light. The rays were called **cathode rays** because they originated at the negative electrode (cathode) and moved to the positive electrode (anode).

### Mass and Charge of the Electron
1. Mass/charge ratio. J. J. Thomson measured the ratio of the mass of a cathode ray particle to its charge. By comparing this ratio with the mass/charge ratio for the lightest charged particle in solution, Thomson estimated that the cathode ray particle weighted less than 1/100 as much as hydrogen, the lightest atom.
2. Charge. Robert Millikan measured the charge of the electron. Accomplished by observing the movement of oil droplets in an apparatus that contained electrically charged plates and an X-ray source. X-rays knocked electrons from has molecules in the air within the apparatus, and the electrons stuck to an oil droplet falling through a hole in a positively charged plate. With the electric field off, Millikan measured the mass of the droplet from its rate of fall. Then, by adjusting the field's strength, he made the droplet hang suspended in the air and, thus, measured it's total charge.
3. Conclusion: Calculating the mass of an electron.

Mass of electron = mass/charge x charge 
$$ = (-5.686*10^{-12}\frac{kg}{C})(-1.602*10^{-19}C) $$
$$ = 9.109*10^{-31}kg = 9.109*10^{-28}g $$

## Discovery of the Atomic Nucleus
**Ernest Rutherford** proposed his "plum pudding" model of the atom after conducting an experiment where he aimed positively charge alpha particles at a piece of gold foil. Then a circular zinc-sulfide screen registers the deflection (scattering) of the alpha particles by emitting light flashes when the particles strike it. The result was that some alpha particles were deflected by more then 90 degrees ("backwards"). He concluded that there was something small, dense and positively charged deflecting the alpha particles. He proposed that positive particles lie within the nucleus and called them *protons*.

This explained the charged nature of matter but didn't account for the entire mass of the atom. James Chadwick later discovered the *neutron* which is an uncharged dense particle that also resides in the nucleus.

# Atomic Theory Today
## Structure of the Atom
An **atom** is an electrically neutral, spherical entity made of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons.

The **nucleus** consists of positively charged protons and neutrons with no charge. The magnitude of the charges possessed by the protons and the electrons are equal but their signs are opposite.

The diameter of an **atom** is approx: $$ 1*10^{-10} m $$

## Atomic Number, Mass Number and Atomic Symbol
The **atomic number (Z)** of an element equals the number of protons in the nucleus of each of its atoms. All atoms of an element have the same atomic number, and the atomic number of each element is different from that of any other element.

The **mass number (A)** is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.

The **atomic symbol** of an element is based on its English, Latin, or Greek name. It is the identifier for the element. It is often written with the atomic number as a left *subscript* and the mass number as a left *superscript*.

Since the mass number is the sum of the protons and neutrons, the number of neutrons equals the mass number minus the atomic number.

## Isotopes
All atoms of an element have the same atomic number but not necessarily the same mass number. **Isotopes** of an element are atoms that have different number of neutrons and therefore different mass numbers. All carbon atoms have (Z=6) meaning 6 protons and 6 electrons. But not all carbon atoms have 6 neutrons (A=12). 1.11% of carbon atoms can have seven neutrons (A=13). Less then 0.01% can have 8 neutrons (A=14).

The chemical properties of an element are primarily determined by the number of electrons, so all *isotopes of an element have nearly identical chemical behavior*, even though their masses are different. 

## Atomic Masses of the Elements
The mass of an atom is measured *relative* to the mass of an atomic standard. The modern standard is the carbom-12 atom, whose mass is defined as exactly 12 atomic mass units. Thus, the **unified atomic mass unit (u)** is 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The unit name **Dalton** is also acceptable so one carbon-12 atom has a mass of 12 Da or 12 u. The **unified atomic mass unit**  is a mass unit of relative mass but it has  an absolute mass of 1.66054x10^-24 g. Da, u and g/mol all mean the same thing.

The isotopic makeup of an element is determined by **mass spectrometry** which is a method for measuring the relative masses and abundances of atomic-scale particles very precisely. This is done by creating charged particles and separating the particles according to their mass-charge ratio.

**Isotopic mass** is the mass of an isotope relative to the mass of carbon-12. In order to find the **isotopic mass** of an element we take that element and divide it by the mass of carbon 12. Then we multiply it by 12 u to get that element's isotopic mass.

The **atomic mass** of an element is the average of the masses of the naturally occurring isotopes of an element weighted according to their abundances. The **atomic mass** is an *average value* so while no naturally occurring isotope will have that exact atomic mass it is assumed that a sample of a specific element will consist of atoms with that *average value*.

# Elements: Periodic Table
## Organization of Periodic Table
1. Each element has a box that contains its atomic number, atomic symbol, and atomic mass. They go from left to right in increasing atomic number.
2. They boxes are arranged in a grid of *periods* (horizontal rows) and *groups* (vertical rows). Each period has a number from 1 to 7 and each group has a number from 1 to 18.
3. Groups 1, 2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 contain the main-group elements. Groups 3 to 12 are the transition elements. Two horizontal series of inner transition elements, the lanthanoids and the actinoids, fit between the elements in group 3 and group 4 and are placed below the body of the table.

## Classifying the Elements
- The **metals** lie in the lower-left portion of the table.
- The **nonmetals** lie in the small upper-right portion of the table.
- The **metalloids (semimetals)** which lie along the imaginary staircase line, have properties of both metals and nonmetals.

In general elements of the same group have similar chemical properties and elements in a period have different chemical properties.
Despite this classification of three types of elements there is actually a gradation in properties from left to right and top to bottom.

### Group Names
- Group 1 (excluding hydrogen) are known as **alkali metals**.
- Group 2 consists of **alkaline earth metals**.

Elements in groups 1 and 2 are considered highly reactive.

- Group 16 are called the **chalcogens**.
- Group 17 are called **halogens** which are highly reactive nonmetals.
- Group 18 the **noble gases** are relatively unreactive nonmetals.

Other main groups (13 to 15) are named after the first element in the group such as the **nitrogen family**.

# Compounds: Intro to Bonding
The overwhelming majority of elements exist as compounds with other elements. These elements combine in 2 general ways.
1. *Transferring electrons* from one element to another to form **ionic compounds**.
2. *Sharing electrons* between atoms of different elements to form **covalent compounds**.

These processes create **chemical bonds** which are the forces that hold the atoms together in a compound.

## Formation of Ionic Compounds
Composed of **ions**. These are charged particles that form when an atom or small group of atoms gains or loses one or more electrons.

The strength of the ionic bonding depends, to a great extent, on the net strength of these attractions and repulsions and can be described by Coulomb's Law.

![[Physics Laws#Coulomb's Law]]

### Binary Ionic Compound
This is the simplest type of ionic compound composed of two elements. It typically forms when a metal reacts with a nonmetal.
- Each metal atom loses one or more electrons and becomes a **cation**. (Positively charged ion).
- Each nonmetal atom gains one or more electrons and becomes and **anion**. (Negatively charged ion).

A cation or anion derived from a single atom is known as a **monatomic atom**.
**Polyatomic atoms** are derived from a small group of atoms.

### Predicting the Number of Electrons Lost or Gained
- **Metals lose electrons**. Elements in group 1 lose one electron, in group 2 there are two electrons that are lost and aluminum in group 13 loses three electrons.
- **Nonmetals gain electrons**. Elements in group 17 gain one electron, elements in group 16 gain two electrons and elements in group 15 gain three electrons.

## Formation of Covalent Compounds
These form when elements, usually nonmetals, share electrons. A **covalent bond** is formed which is a pair of electrons that are mutually attracted by two nuclei. Atoms of elements, whether the same element or different elements, share electrons to form the molecules of a covalent compound.

### Distinguishing Elements in Covalent and Ionic Substances
Most covalent substances consist of molecules. In contrast to an ionic compound which under ordinary condition contains no molecules. 

Covalent bonding involves the mutual attraction between two (positively charged) nuclei and the two (negatively charged) electrons that reside between them. Ionic bonding involves the mutual attraction between positive and negative ions.

### Polyatomic Ions: Covalent Bonds within Ions
**Polyatomic Ions** are two or more atoms bonded covalently and have a net positive or negative charge. In many reactions, the polyatomic ion stays together as a unit.

# Formula, Name and Mass of a Compound
## Binary Ionic Compounds
Two general rules.
1. For all ionic compounds, the name and formula give the positive ion (cation) first and the negative ion (anion) second.
2. For all binary ionic compounds, the name of the cation is the name of the metal, and the name of the anion has the suffix -ide added to the root of the name of the nonmetal.

### Compounds of Elements That Form One Ion
- Monatomic ions of main-group elements have the same ionic charge. The alkali metals form ions with a +1 charge and the halogens form ions with a -1 charge.
- For cations in group 1 and 2, the ion charge equals the group number. (Exceptions would be Sn2+ and Pb2+).
- For anions, the ion charge equals the group number minus 18.

An ionic compound consists of an array of ions rather than separate molecules so its formula represents the **formula unit**. A **formula unit**  is the chemical unit of a compound that contains the relative number of the types of atoms or ions expressed in the chemical formula for the compound.

### Compounds with Metals That Form More than One Ion
Names of compounds containing an element that can form more than one ion include roman numerals right after the metal ion's name to indicate its ionic charge. There are also some trivial names used for the higher and lower charged ions.
- The suffix -ous for the ion with the *lower* charge.
- The suffix -ic for the ion with the *higher* charge.

## Compounds That Contain Polyatomic Ions
When two or more of the same polyatomic ion are present in a formula unit, this ion appears in parentheses with the subscript written outside.

### Families of Oxoanions
Most polyatomic ions are **oxoanions** (or oxyanions), ions in which an element, usually a nonmetal, is bonded to one or more oxygen atoms. There are several families of two or four oxoanions that differ only in the number of oxygen atoms.

**For Families with two oxoanions.**
- The ion with *more* O atoms rakes the nonmetal root and the suffix -ate.
- The ion with *fewer* O atoms takes the nonmental root and the suffix -ite.

**For Families with four oxoanions.**
- The ion with the *most* O atoms has the prefix per-, the nonmetal root, and the suffix -ate.
- The ion with *one less* O atom has just the root and the suffix -ate.
- The ion with *two fewer* O atoms has just the root and the suffix -ite.
- The ion with the *least (three fewer)* O atoms has the prefix hypo-, the root, and the suffix -ite.

### Hydrated Ionic Compounds
**Hydrates** are a type of ionic compound that have a specific number of water molecules in each formula unit which is shown after a centered dot in the formula and noted in the name by a Greek numerical prefix before the word *hydrate*.
$$ MgSO_4 \cdot 7H_2O $$
This formula's name is magnesium heptahydrate.

### Numerical Prefixes

| Number | Prefix |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1      | mono-  |
| 2      | di-    |
| 3      | tri-   |
| 4      | tetra- |
| 5      | penta- |
| 6      | hexa-  |
| 7      | hepta- |
| 8      | octa-  |
| 9      | nona-  |
| 10     | deca-  |

### Acid Names from Anion Names
We consider acids as anions that are connected to the number of hydrogen ions needed for charge neutrality. The two common types of acids are binary acids and oxoacids.

**Binary acid** solutions form when certain gaseous compounds dissolve in water. For example when gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) dissolved in water, it forms hydrochloric acid:

prefix hydro- + nonmetal root + suffix -ic + separate word acid.
hydro +chlor + ic + acid = hydrochloric acid.

**Oxoacid** names are similar to the names of oxoanions, except for two suffix changes.
- The -ate in the anion becomes -ic in the acid.
- The -ite in the anion becomes -ous in the acid.

The oxoanion prefixes hypo- and per-  are retained.

[[The Components of Matter#Families of Oxoanions]].

### Binary Covalent Compounds
They are typically formed by the combination of two non-metals.
- The element with the lower group number in the periodic table comes first in the name. The element with the higher group number comes second and is names with its root and the suffix -ide. For example nitrogen trifluoride. (*Exception*: When the compound contains oxygen and any of the halogens chlorine, bromine, and iodine, the halogen is named first.)
- If both elements are in the same group, the element with the higher period number is named first. 
- Covalent compounds use Greek numerical prefixes to indicate the number of atoms of each element. The first element in the name has a prefix only when more than one atom of it is present; the second element usually has a prefix. When the second element name begins with a vowel, we usually drop the vowel attached to the prefix.

### The Simplest Organic Compounds
**Hydrocarbons** contain *only* carbon and hydrogen. 

**Alkanes** are named with a root, based on the number of C atoms in the chain, followed by the suffix -ane. Methane, propane, and butane are all examples of *straight-chain alkanes* since they contain no branches.

### Representing Molecules with a Formula and a Model
-  A **molecular formula** uses element symbols and often numerical subscripts to give the *actual* number of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compounds. $$ H_2O $$
- A **structural formula** shows the relative placement and connections of the atoms in a molecule. $$ H:O:H $$ $$ H-O-H $$
- In models, colored balls represent atoms. A **ball and stick** model shows atoms as balls and bonds as sticks. The angles between the bonds are accurate.
- A **space-filling model** is an accurately scaled up image of the molecule, so it shows the relative sizes of the atoms, the relative distances between the nuclei (centers of the spheres), and the angles between the bonds.

# Mixtures: Classification and Separation
Matter usually occurs as mixtures in the natural world. There are two broad classes of mixtures.
- A **heterogeneous mixture**has one or more visible boundaries between the components.
- A **homogeneous mixture (solution)** has no visible boundaries because the components are individual atoms, ions, or molecules.

Solutions can exist in all of the physical states. **Aqueous solutions** which are solutions that are in water are important in the lab.

Mixtures are different from compounds in 3 different ways.
1. The proportions of the components can vary.
2. The individual properties of the components are observable.
3. The components can be separated by physical means.
