# Simple Harmonic Motion
Understanding the [[Properties of Oscillations]] is vital to the notes in this section.

## Horizontal Mass Spring System
Assuming the surface that the system rests on is frictionless we could look only at the force of the spring.

Regarding **F = -kx** the negative is there since if the spring is compressed in the negative direction it would exert more force against that motion so there would be more force in the positive direction and vice versa.

Now how to solve the differential equation.

The problem is that the variable **i** is what as known as an imaginary number. So this equation makes sense mathematically but the problem is we are talking about displacement and when we measure that with a ruler it is a very real answer. There are no imaginary numbers on the ruler.

**ABOVE PART INVOLVING THE IMAGINARY NUMBERS WILL NOT BE TESTED IN THIS COURSE.**

This underlined function is the most general real solution.

Angular Frequency:
$$ w = 2\pi f $$

[[Phase]] effects most of the properties of oscillations and it is determined not by the physical characteristics of the system but rather how the oscillating system was set in motion.
