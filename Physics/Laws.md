# Laws
#### Newton's First Law
An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction [unless acted upon by an unbalanced force](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/newtlaws/u2l1d.cfm#balanced).

#### Newton's Second Law
The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
$$ a = \frac{F_{net}}{m} $$
But it's easier to remember when it is rearranged to the below form.
$$ F_{net} = m•a $$

#### Newton's Third Law
When two bodies interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
