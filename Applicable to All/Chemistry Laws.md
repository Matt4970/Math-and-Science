### Law of Mass Conservation
The total mass of substances does not change during a chemical reaction. The number of substances may change and, by definition, their properties must, but the total amount of matter remains constant. **Matter can not be created or destroyed.**

### Law of Definite (or constant) Composition
No matter what it's source, a particular compound is composed of the same elements in the same parts (fractions) by mass. 

The **fraction by mass** is the part of the compound's mass that each element contributes. It is obtained by dividing the mass of each element by the mass of the compound. The **percent by mass** is just the fraction by mass expressed as a percent.

### Law of Multiple Proportions
If elements A and B react to form two compounds, the different masses of B that combine with a fixed mass of A can be expressed as a ratio of small whole numbers.
